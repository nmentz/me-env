turn off interface so you can modify it
sudo ip link set dev interface_name down

then run
sudo ip link set dev interface_name address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff (all f's is not a unique identifier, don't use it).
stuff is sent to all f's when all l2 network devices are intended to recieve something like an arp request.

funny mac names you can use instead
b0:bb:1e:fa:ce:dd
de:fe:c8:fa:ca:de
